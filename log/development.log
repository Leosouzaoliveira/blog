Estima-se que o número de exemplares produzidos tanto na Rússia como sob licença em países como a Bulgária, China, Hungria, Índia, Coréia do Norte, Romênia entre outros, chegue a impressionante cifra de 90 milhões. Países como a Finlândia e Israel também basearam-se no projeto deste fuzil para produzirem seus modelos M62 e Galil respectivamente. É caracterizado por sua grande rusticidade, facilidade de produção em massa, simplicidade de operação e manutenção, além de reconhecida estabilidade em baixas e altas temperaturas. Deixa a desejar nos requisitos precisão, ergonomia e peso.\r\nSeu funcionamento se dá de modo similar aos demais fuzis de assalto, pelo aproveitamento indireto dos gases que são desviados da parte posterior do cano até um cilindro montado acima deste, onde pressionam um êmbolo de longo curso que aciona o recuo do ferrolho de trancamento rotativo. O ferrolho desliza sobre dois trilhos na caixa da culatra com uma folga significativa entre as peças móveis e fixas, o que permite que opere com o seu interior saturado de lama ou areia. Dispara munição 7,62 x 39 mm nos modos automático e semi-automático. Seu registro de tiro e segurança é considerado por muitos sua principal desvantagem, não corrigida nos modelos posteriores. É lento e desconfortável, exige esforço extra para operar, especialmente com luvas, e quando acionado produz um \"clique\" alto e distinto. Outra desvantagem é a posição do ferrolho, que permanece fechado após o último tiro.\r\nÉ alimentado por um carregador tipo cofre metálico bifilar de trinta projéteis, com retém localizado à frente do guarda-mato. Outros tipos de carregadores como o de quarenta projéteis ou o tambor de 75 projéteis da RPK também podem ser usados. Seu aparelho de pontaria é graduado de 100 m a 1000 m (800 no AK), e um ajuste fixo que pode ser usado para todas as faixas de até 300 metros. Pode também pode ser equipado com lançador de granadas montado sob o cano. A versão de coronha dobrável foi desenvolvida para as tropas aerotransportadas e denominadas AKS (AKMS). Os AK foram concebidos com baionetas destacáveis do tipo faca, que associada a sua bainha transforma-se numa tesoura de cortar arames.", "tag_list"=>"União Soviética, Segunda Guerra, rifle de assalto"}, "button"=>"", "id"=>"1"}
